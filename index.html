                    <h2>facts about dogs</h2>
                    <p>1. Dogs are the most popular pet on the planet!
                        A third of ALL households around the world have a dog. These playful, friendly, loyal animals make great companions, but they can also be fierce and tough protectors, or intelligent helpers.
                        
                        2. They evolved from a now-extinct species of wolf.
                        Dogs were the first animal domesticated (tamed) by humans, over 20,000 years ago! As they evolved from wolves, their skulls, teeth and paws shrank, and they became more docile and obedient.
                        
                        FUN FACT!
                        
                        Evidence from fossils suggests that five types of dog had evolved by the Bronze Age, around 4500BC. These were mastiffs, wolf-type dogs, dogs similar to greyhounds, pointing dogs and herding dogs. Bow wow!

                <aside><p>Dogs have been used in scientific research for a long time. They are physiologically similar to humans and suffer from similar diseases such as diabetes, epilepsy, cancer, and eye disease. Dogs can be easily trained to cooperate in research, for example, they can be taught how to jump on weighing machines and to accept muzzles in respiratory research. Beagles are used in the majority of research involving dogs. Those used are from particular strains and the dogs are genetically extremely alike. Beagles love to live in packs, and are content in the company of other dogs, making them well-suited to life in a laboratory setting.</p></aside>
