                  Typographical or spelling error
It's possible the intended word is "conditional," often used in programming, logic, or decision-making contexts to describe something that depends on a condition. For example, in coding, a "conditional statement" like if...else executes actions based on whether a condition is true or false.
Brand, username, or proper noun
"Condingal" might be a company name, product, app, or online handle that is not widely documented. Unique names or creative spellings often appear in tech platforms, games, or social media usernames.
Specialized jargon or niche term
If the term comes from a specific field (e.g., programming library, local culture, or game terminology)
